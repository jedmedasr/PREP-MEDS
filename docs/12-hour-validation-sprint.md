# PREP-MEDS — 12-hour ingredient/formulation validation sprint

Start: 2026-11-06. Target: four 3-hour work blocks, not a guarantee of clinical approval.
Scope: active ingredient × clinically distinct formulation. Brands/aliases inherit validated group guidance; every canonical medication ID must be mapped and tested.

## Block 1 — inventory and safety triage (start now)
- [ ] Enumerate `terminologyDataset.medications` and ingredients into machine-readable manifest.
- [ ] Deduplicate into ingredient/formulation review groups, preserve combinations and meaningful route/release differences.
- [ ] Record exact totals, unmapped IDs, high-risk priority, guideline sources and versions.
- [ ] Check PR #37 CI and repair regressions. Record actual passing run ID and commit.
Acceptance: committed manifest, exact denominators, zero silent unmapped IDs, CI status documented.

## Block 2 — antithrombotics (at +3 hours)
- [ ] FIRST verify Block 1 artifacts/commit and acceptance criteria; complete any unfinished item before advancing.
- [ ] Reconcile ASGE 2016 vs ACG/CAG 2022, BSG/ESGE 2021 and relevant current guidance per distinct antithrombotic group.
- [ ] Cover procedural bleeding risk, renal function, indication/thrombotic risk, interruption, bridging, restart, DAPT and aspirin.
- [ ] Add positive, negative, edge-case tests and source-linked conflict notes.
Acceptance: antithrombotic group-level review ledger and passing tests, or explicitly listed blockers.

## Block 3 — diabetes and other high-risk drugs (at +6 hours)
- [ ] FIRST verify Block 2 artifacts/commit and acceptance criteria; complete any unfinished item before advancing.
- [ ] Review insulin by basal/prandial/pump and clinically distinct formulation, GLP-1 agents, SGLT2 inhibitors, combinations and other high-risk periendoscopic drugs.
- [ ] Cross-check diet/prep/NPO timing and individualized prescriber approval; test type 1 basal and hypoglycemia safeguards.
- [ ] Map every brand/alias to the correct group; test no missing ingredients in combinations.
Acceptance: documented evidence, scenarios, tests, and unresolved cases.

## Block 4 — remainder, integration and final report (at +9 hours)
- [ ] FIRST verify Block 3 artifacts/commit and acceptance criteria; complete any unfinished item before advancing.
- [ ] Complete remaining group-level guideline reviews, mapping and regression coverage, prioritizing clinical risk.
- [ ] Run complete CI and build, check preview, reconcile audit ledger and count coverage.
- [ ] Report exact reviewed/total groups, mapped/total IDs, tests, unresolved discrepancies, clinical sign-off status.
- [ ] Merge only if CI passes AND patient-facing release governance permits; never activate unapproved shadow rules.
Acceptance: auditable completion report; if incomplete, explicit unfinished groups and realistic revised ETA, no fabricated 100%.

## Mandatory handoff protocol for every run
1. Fetch this checklist and the latest GitHub branch/PR head; inspect prior run's commits, tests and evidence.
2. State **previous block: PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL**, with commit hashes and missing acceptance criteria. Do not infer success from prior messages.
3. Finish any incomplete prior-block tasks first. Then execute the next block's work, commit tangible artifacts, run tests and update this file.
4. Send user a concise progress report with actual completed/total review groups and medication IDs mapped, failures, next actions.
5. If clinical guidelines conflict or independent approval is missing, mark NEEDS_REVIEW and keep patient-facing rules fail-closed.
